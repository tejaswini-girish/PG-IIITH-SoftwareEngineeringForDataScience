To stash your unsaved files, use the following git command: git stash.
This will give you a clean working tree to pull your remote repository into. Once youâ€™ve successfully pulled into your branch, you can unstash your files, commit them as a separate commit and resolve any file conflicts that you may have.

To unstash your files, use git pop. This will move the changes stashed and reapplies them to your current working copy.
